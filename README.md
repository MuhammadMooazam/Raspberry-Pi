# What is Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.

Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom. The Raspberry Pi project originally leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools and in developing countries.

# What is a Raspberry Pi used for?
All over the world, people use the Raspberry Pi to learn programming skills, build hardware projects, do home automation, implement Kubernetes clusters and Edge computing, and even use them in industrial applications.

# Difference Between Raspberry pi and Arduino:

## Raspberry Pi: 
1. Linux               
2. Can't be developed seperately               
3. sd card (only class 10) minimun memory 16gb or maximum 1tb               
4. 1 GH processor               
5. 1gb, 2gb, 4gb, 8gb or 16gb RAM                
6. Display HDMI/TFT/IPS               
7. Mouse / keyboard               
8. 40 Pins (GPIO -> General Purpose Input Output)               
9. WiFi Bult-in               
10. Bluetooth 2.0/4.0               
11. PiCamera               
13. 3.5 mm AudioJack               
14. 7+ Languages Support               
15. 5volt 3amp only               
16. LAN Port               
17. Own Operating System               

## Arduino:
1. No Linux
2. custom mode
3. no hard disk / no memory
4. 11.05 MHz
5. No RAM
6. No display
7. No mouse / keyboard
8. no USB port
9. 16 Pins
10. No WiFi
11. No Bluetooth
12. No port
13. no speaker
14. 1 language (only C++)
15. power (2 way)
16. No LAN
17. No Operating System
